Coding best practices:
  Each function should only have only one return point.
 
  Functions with many parameters should also have a single associative array used instead.
 
  Classes parameters should be an associative array if more then one parameter used.
 
  In classes you should validate all input variables to ensure the class never raises exceptions.
 
  Classes should have three logging variables: debug, warnings, errors.
    (In case of errors the code should stop at the first error.)
 
  Use code refactoring to avoid having long functions or similar code blocks.
 
  Testing is the true programming. As such unit tests should always be created and they should be distributed with the code.
 
  Commenting should be used whenever necessary but not in excess.
 
  All codes should be documented to ensure anyone can understand: 
    What it is used for.
    How it works.
    How it should be used.
 
 
 
Naming standard:
  JavaScript and Python:
    Function and variable names should use camelCase.
    Classes should use UpperCamelCase.
    Namespaces should use lowercase.
 
  PHP:
    Variable names should be all lowercase, with words separated by underscores.
    Functions should follow variable standard with the first word representing the type.
      (E.g. array_something, str_something, get_something).
    Classes should follow the same standard as variables but having each word in Upper_Case.
